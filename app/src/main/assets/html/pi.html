    <p style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Therapeutic
            indications:</span> Ceftriaxone is indicated for
        the treatment of the following infections in adults
        and children including term neonates (from birth):
        Bacterial Meningitis, Community acquired
        pneumonia, Hospital acquired pneumonia, Acute
        otitis media, Intra‐abdominal infections, Complicated
        urinary tract infections (including pyelonephritis),
        Infections of bones and joints, Complicated skin and
        soft tissue infections, Gonorrhoea, Syphilis, Bacterial
        endocarditis. Ceftriaxone may be used: For treatment
        of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive
        pulmonary disease in adults. For treatment of
        disseminated Lyme borreliosis (early (stage II) and
        late (stage Ill)) in adults and children including
        neonates from 15 days of age. For Pre‐Operative
        prophylaxis of surgical site infections. In the
        management of neutropenic patients with fever that
        is suspected to be due to a bacterial infection. In the
        treatment of patients with bacteraemia that occurs in
        association with, or is suspected to be associated
        with, any of the infections listed above.</p>
    <p>Ceftriaxone should be co‐administered with other
        antibacterial agents whenever the possible range of
        causative bacteria would not fall within its spectrum.
        Consideration should be given to official guidelines on
        the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Method of administration:</p>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">For pre‐operative prophylaxis of surgical site
        infections, ceftriaxone should be administered 30‐90
        minutes prior to surgery.
        For ceftriaxone 250 IM, 500 IM , 1000 IM only:
        Ceftriaxone can be administered by deep
        intramuscular injection. Intramuscular injections
        should be injected well within the bulk of a relatively
        large muscle and not more than 1 g should be
        injected at one site. As the solvent used is lidocaine,
        the resulting solution should never be administered
        intravenously. Accidental intravenous injection
        should be checked for by aspiration of the syringe
        before injection.
        The maximum single dose of lidocaine in children
        should not exceed 5 mg/kg bodyweight.</p>
    <p>For obese children, the maximum dose should be
        calculated based on ideal bodyweight for their gender
        and age.
        For ceftriaxone 500 IV, 1000 IV only: Ceftriaxone can
        be administered by intravenous infusion over at least
        30 minutes (preferred route) or by slow intravenous
        injection over 5 minutes. Intravenous intermittent
        injection should be given over 5 minutes preferably in
        larger veins. Intravenous doses of 50 mg/kg or more
        in infants and children up to 12 years of age should be
        given by infusion.
        Intramuscular administration should be considered
        when the intravenous route is not possible or less
        appropriate for the patient.
        For doses greater than 2g intravenous administration
        should be used.
        Diluents containing calcium,. (e.g. Ringer’s solution or
        Hartmann’s solution), should not be used to
        reconstitute ceftriaxone vials or to further dilute a
        reconstituted vial for intravenous administration
        because a precipitate can form.</p>
    <p>Precipitation of ceftriaxone‐calcium can also occur
        when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium containing
        solutions in the same intravenous administration line.
        Therefore, ceftriaxone and calcium‐containing
        solutions must not be mixed or administered
        simultaneously.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Special warnings and precautions:</p>

    <p>Hypersensitivity reactions: As with all beta-lactam
        antibacterial agents, serious and occasionally fatal
        hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. In case
        of severe hypersensitivity reactions, treatment with
        ceftriaxone must be discontinued immediately and
        adequate emergency measures must be initiated.
        Before beginning treatment, it should be established
        whether the patient has a history of severe
        hypersensitivity reactions to ceftriaxone, to other
        cephalosporins or to any other type of beta‐lactam
        agent. Caution should be used if ceftriaxone is given
        to patients with a history of non‐severe
        hypersensitivity to other beta‐lactam agents because
        Patients Hypersensitive to these medicines may be
        Hypersensitive to Ceftriaxone as well (Cross‐ Allergy).

    <p>Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (Stevens Johnson
        syndrome or Lyell’s syndrome/toxic epidermal
        necrolysis) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and
        systemic symptoms (DRESS) which can be life
        threatening or fatal have been reported; however, the
        frequency of these events is not known.
        Immune mediated haemolytic anaemia: An immune
        mediated haemolytic anaemia has been observed in
        patients receiving cephalosporin class antibacterials
        including Ceftriaxone. Severe cases of haemolytic
        anaemia, including fatalities, have been reported
        during Ceftriaxone treatment in both adults and
        children. If a patient develops anaemia while on
        ceftriaxone, the diagnosis of a cephalosporinassociated
        anaemia should be considered and
        ceftriaxone discontinued until the aetiology is
        determined.
        Long term treatment: During prolonged treatment
        complete blood count should be performed at regular
        intervals.</p>

    <p>Colitis/Overgrowth of non-susceptible microorganisms:
        Antibacterial agent-associated colitis and pseudomembranous
        colitis have been reported with nearly all
        antibacterial agents, including ceftriaxone, and may
        range in severity from mild to life-threatening.
        Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in
        patients who present with diarrhoea during or
        subsequent to the administration of ceftriaxone.
        Discontinuation of therapy with ceftriaxone and the
        administration of specific treatment for Clostridium
        difficile should be considered. Medicinal products that
        inhibit peristalsis should not be given. Superinfections
        with non-susceptible micro-organisms may occur as with
        other antibacterial agents.
        Patients with severe hepatic and renal impairment: In
        patients with both severe renal and hepatic dysfunction,
        close clinical monitoring for safety and efficacy is
        advised.
        Interference with serological testing: Interference with
        Coombs tests may occur, as Ceftriaxone may lead to
        false-positive test results. Ceftriaxone can also lead to
        false-positive test results for galactosaemia). Nonenzymatic
        methods for the glucose determination in
        urine may give false-positive results. Urine glucose
        determination during therapy with Ceftriaxone should be done enzymatically. The
        presence of ceftriaxone may falsely lower estimated
        blood glucose values obtained with some blood
        glucose monitoring systems. Please refer to
        instructions for use for each system. Alternative
        testing methods should be used if necessary.
        Sodium: Each gram of Ceftriaxone contains 3.6 mmol
        sodium. This should be taken into consideration in
        patients on a controlled sodium diet.
        Antibacterial spectrum: Ceftriaxone has a limited
        spectrum of antibacterial activity and may not be
        suitable for use as a single agent for the treatment of
        some types of infections unless the pathogen has
        already been confirmed. In polymicrobial infections,
        where suspected pathogens include organisms
        resistant to ceftriaxone, administration of an
        additional antibiotic should be considered.
        Biliary lithiasis: When shadows are observed on
        sonograms, consideration should be given to the
        possibility of precipitates of calcium ceftriaxone.
        Shadows, which have been mistaken for gallstones,
        have been detected on sonograms of the gallbladder and have been observed more frequently at
        ceftriaxone doses of 1 g per day and above. Caution
        should be particularly considered in the paediatric
        population. Such precipitates disappear after
        discontinuation of ceftriaxone therapy. Rarely
        precipitates of calcium ceftriaxone have been
        associated with symptoms. In symptomatic cases,
        conservative nonsurgical management is
        recommended and discontinuation of ceftriaxone
        treatment should be considered by the physician
        based on specific benefit risk assessment.
        Biliary stasis: Cases of pancreatitis, possibly of biliary
        obstruction aetiology, have been reported in patients
        treated with Ceftriaxone. Most patients presented
        with risk factors for biliary stasis and biliary sludge e.g.
        preceding major therapy, severe illness and total
        parenteral nutrition. A trigger or cofactor of
        Ceftriaxone-related biliary precipitation could not be
        ruled out.
        Renal lithiasis: Cases of renal lithiasis has been
        reported, which is reversible upon discontinuation of
        ceftriaxone. In symptomatic cases, sonography should
        be performed.</p>

    <p>Use in patients with history of renal lithiasis or with
        hypercalciuria should be considered by the physician
        based on specific benefit risk assessment.
        Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (JHR): Some patients
        with spirochete infections may experience a Jarisch-
        Herxheimer reaction (JHR) shortly after ceftriaxone
        treatment is started. JHR is usually a self-limiting
        condition or can be managed by symptomatic
        treatment. The antibiotic treatment should not be
        discontinued if such reaction occurs.
        For ceftriaxone 250 IM, 500 IM, 1000 IM only:
        Lidocaine: Lidocaine (contained in the solvent for the
        intramuscular injection) should be used with caution
        in patients with myasthenia gravis, epilepsy, impaired
        cardiac conduction, congestive heart failure,
        bradycardia or respiratory depression. Lidocaine
        should also be used with caution in cases where
        agents are known to interact with lidocaine either to
        increase its availability or additive effects e.g.
        phenytoin or prolong its elimination e.g. hepatic or
        renal insufficiency where the metabolites of lidocaine
        may accumulate.</p>

    <p>Intramuscular lidocaine may increase creatinine
        phosphokinase concentrations which can interfere
        with the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.
        Lidocaine has been shown to be porphyrinogenic in
        animals and should be avoided in persons suffering
        from porphyria. In neonates, the optimum serum
        concentration of lidocaine required to avoid toxicity,
        such as convulsions and cardiac arrhythmias, in this
        age group is not known.
        For ceftriaxone 500 IV, 1000 IV only: Use of lidocaine:
        In case a lidocaine solution is used as a solvent,
        ceftriaxone solutions must only be used for
        intramuscular injection. Contraindications to
        lidocaine, warnings and other relevant information as
        detailed in the Summary of Product Characteristics of
        lidocaine must be considered before use.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Interaction with other medicinal products and other
            forms of interaction: </span>Ceftriaxone: Ceftriaxone must
        not be administered simultaneously with
        calcium‐containing intravenous solutions, including
        continuous calcium‐containing infusions such as
        parenteral nutrition via a V‐site.</p>

    <p>Concomitant use with oral anticoagulants may
        increase the anti-vitamin K effect and the risk of
        bleeding. It is recommended that the International
        Normalised Ratio (INR) is monitored frequently and
        the posology of the anti-vitamin K drug adjusted
        accordingly, both during and after treatment with
        ceftriaxone.
        There is conflicting evidence regarding a potential
        increase in renal toxicity of aminoglycosides when
        used with cephalosporins. The recommended
        monitoring of aminoglycoside levels (and renal
        function) in clinical practice should be closely
        adhered to in such cases. In an in-vitro study
        antagonistic effects have been observed with the
        combination of chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone. The
        clinical relevance of this finding is unknown.
        There have been no reports of an interaction
        between ceftriaxone and oral calcium-containing
        products or interaction between intramuscular
        ceftriaxone and calcium-containing products
        (intravenous or oral).
        In patients treated with ceftriaxone, the Coombs' test
        may lead to false-positive test results.</p>

    <p>Ceftriaxone, like other antibiotics, may result in falsepositive
        tests for galactosaemia. Likewise, nonenzymatic
        methods for glucose determination in
        urine may yield false-positive results. For this reason,
        glucose level determination in urine during therapy
        with ceftriaxone should be carried out enzymatically.
        No impairment of renal function has been observed
        after concurrent administration of large doses of
        ceftriaxone and potent diuretics (e.g. furosemide).
        Simultaneous administration of probenecid does not
        reduce the elimination of ceftriaxone.
        Pharmacodynamic interactions: Systemic toxic effects
        may be additive during concomitant use of active
        substances that are structural analogues of amidetype
        local anaesthetics (e.g. antiarrhythmic drugs like
        mexiletine or tocainide). The i.m. injection of
        Ceftriaxone (with a solvent containing lidocaine)
        should therefore be administered with particular
        caution to patients who are undergoing treatment
        with such medicinal products.
        The effects of muscle relaxants can be enhanced by
        lidocaine. Please refer to the summary of product characteristics for the medicinal products being
        administered concomitantly.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">For ceftriaxone 250 IM, 500 IM, 1000 IM only
            Lidocaine: Pharmacokinetic interactions:</span> lidocaine is
        a substrate for the CYP450 enzymes CYP1A2 and
        CYP3A4. Lidocaine metabolism can therefore be
        inhibited by concomitant administration of CYP
        inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, erythromycin,
        cimetidine) and enhanced by concomitant
        administration of enzyme inductors (e.g. barbiturates,
        carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, rifampicin).</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Fertility, pregnancy and lactation</span>
        Ceftriaxone:
        Pregnancy: Ceftriaxone crosses the placental barrier.
        There are limited amounts of data from the use of
        ceftriaxone in pregnant women. Ceftriaxone should
        only be administered during pregnancy and in
        particular in the first trimester of pregnancy if the
        benefit outweighs the risk.
        Breastfeeding: Ceftriaxone is excreted into human
        milk in low concentrations but at therapeutic doses of
        ceftriaxone no effects on the breastfed infants are
        anticipated. However, a risk of diarrhea and fungal infection of the mucous membranes cannot be
        excluded. The possibility of sensitisation should be
        taken into account. A decision must be made whether
        to discontinue breast‐feeding or to
        discontinue/abstain from ceftriaxone therapy, taking
        into account the benefit of breast feeding for the
        child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.
        Fertility: Reproductive studies have shown no
        evidence of adverse effects on male or female
        fertility.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">For ceftriaxone 250 IM, 500 IM, 1000 IM only: </span>
        Pregnancy: Although animal studies have revealed no
        evidence of harm to the foetus, lidocaine should not
        be administered during early pregnancy unless the
        benefits are considered to outweigh the risks.
        Breastfeeding: Small amounts of lidocaine are
        secreted into breast milk and the possibility of an
        allergic reaction in the infant, albeit remote, should
        be borne in mind when using lidocaine in nursing
        mothers.
        Fertility: There is no data available on fertility with
        the use of lidocaine.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Effects on ability to drive and use machines: </span>
        During
        treatment with ceftriaxone, undesirable effects may
        occur (e.g. dizziness), which may influence the ability
        to drive and use machines. Patients should be
        cautious when driving or operating machinery.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Undesirable effects:</p>
    <p>Ceftriaxone: The most frequently reported adverse
        reactions for ceftriaxone are eosinophilia, leucopenia,
        thrombocytopenia, diarrhoea, rash, and hepatic
        enzymes increased.
        For ceftriaxone 250 IM, 500 IM , 1000 IM only:
        Lidocaine: There are no specific data for the
        combined use of ceftriaxone and lidocaine. Adverse
        reactions to lidocaine are usually the result of raised
        plasma concentrations due to accidental
        intravascular injection, excessive dosage or rapid
        absorption from highly vascular areas, or may result
        from a hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy or diminished
        tolerance on the part of the patient. Systemic toxicity
        mainly involves the central nervous system and/or
        the cardiovascular system.</p>

    <p>Always read the full prescribing information.
        Other less common side effects are listed in full
        prescribing information.
        Health care professionals are asked to report any
        suspected adverse reactions to the Egyptian
        Pharmacovigilance Center (EPVC).
        Ministry Of Health leaflet approval date 20/1/2020.</p>
