    <ul>
        <li>The dose depends on the severity,
            susceptibility, site and type of
            infection and on the age and
            hepato-renal function of the
            patient.</li>
        <li>The duration of therapy varies
            according to the course of the
            disease. As with antibiotic therapy
            in general, administration of
            ceftriaxone should be continued for
            48 - 72 hours after the patient has
            become afebrile or evidence of
            bacterial eradication has been
            achieved.</li>
